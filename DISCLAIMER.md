⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL NOTICE: This research involves a severe AI vulnerability with potential real-world safety implications. Access is governed by a strict legal and ethical disclaimer. You must read the full DISCLAIMER.md before proceeding.

# LEGAL DISCLAIMER, ETHICAL NOTICE, AND TERMS OF USE
## **1. OVERARCHING PRINCIPLE & INTENT**
This repository and all associated documents (collectively, the "Research") are published **EXCLUSIVELY for defensive cybersecurity research, policy analysis, and academic discourse**. The primary intent is to identify critical security failures in public artificial intelligence systems, advocate for urgent remediation, and inform the development of robust international governance frameworks to prevent AI-facilitated harm.
**THE RESEARCHER AND CONTRIBUTORS UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN AND DO NOT CONDONE ANY USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR ILLEGAL, MALICIOUS, OR HARMful ACTIVITIES.** The public dissemination of this redacted Research is a measure of last resort, undertaken after exhaustive responsible disclosure attempts have failed to yield timely remediation of a critical, publicly accessible vulnerability.
## **2. STRICT PROHIBITIONS & LEGAL WARNINGS**
### **2.1. Absolute Prohibitions**
By accessing this Research, you agree and acknowledge that you are **PROHIBITED** from using it to:
* **Develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, or use** any Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) weapon or weaponizable agent.
* **Facilitate, assist, or enable** any person, group, or state in the aforementioned activities.
* **Conduct any activity** that violates the **Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)**, the **Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)**, the **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**, **United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540**, or any applicable national implementing legislation.
* **Attempt to weaponize** the theoretical knowledge or procedural descriptions contained herein. No physical synthesis, cultivation, or acquisition of materials is described or encouraged.
### **2.2. Legal Consequences of Misuse**
Any violation of these prohibitions may constitute severe criminal offenses under international and national law, potentially resulting in:
* Prosecution for terrorism, weapons proliferation, or related crimes.
* Civil liability for damages resulting from misuse.
* Sanctions from international regulatory bodies.
## **3. ETHICAL RESEARCH FRAMEWORK & COMPLIANCE**
This Research was conducted and disclosed in accordance with the highest ethical standards of cybersecurity and dual-use research:
* **Defensive Purpose**: The motive is solely to protect public safety and improve systemic AI security.
* **Responsible Disclosure**: The vulnerability was reported to the vendor (Microsoft Security Response Center) immediately upon discovery on September 18, 2025, initiating a **75+ day coordinated disclosure grace period** before this public release.
* **No Weaponization Principle**: At no point were any physical CBRN agents or weapons created, acquired, or tested. The research is confined to digital interaction with an AI model.
* **Redaction & Control of Information**: The public version of this Research has been systematically redacted to remove **all technically executable details, precise chemical/biological formulas, and operational weaponization protocols**. Such information remains restricted to authorized vendor and government security teams under non-disclosure agreements.
* **Compliance with Guidelines**: The methodology aligns with:
* **ISO/IEC 29147:2018** (Vulnerability Disclosure)
* **FIRST.org** Best Practices for Coordinated Disclosure
* **IEEE P7000™ Series** (Ethical AI Design)
* **National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB)** guidelines for Dual-Use Research of Concern (DURC)
