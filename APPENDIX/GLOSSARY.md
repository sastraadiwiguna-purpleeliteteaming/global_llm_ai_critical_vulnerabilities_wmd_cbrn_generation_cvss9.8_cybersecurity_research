## P-R
### Prompt Engineering
The practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to elicit desired responses from AI systems.
### Prompt Injection
A security vulnerability where malicious input prompts cause AI systems to bypass safety measures or perform unintended actions.
### Proliferation
The spread of weapons of mass destruction or related technology and knowledge.
### Radiological Weapon
A weapon designed to disperse radioactive material to cause contamination rather than nuclear explosion.
### Red Team
Security professionals who simulate adversary attacks to test and improve defensive measures.
### Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
A training method where AI models learn from human feedback on their responses, used to align models with human preferences.
## S-U
### Sarin
A highly toxic nerve agent that inhibits acetylcholinesterase, causing respiratory failure and death.
### Scope (CVSS Metric)
Whether a vulnerability in one component affects resources beyond its security authority.
### Semantics
The meaning behind words or queries, as opposed to just their literal 
### Synthetic Biology
The design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, with potential dual-use applications.
### Treaty Violation
Breach of international agreements such as the CWC or BWC through development or dissemination of prohibited weapons knowledge.
### UN Resolution 1540
A United Nations Security Council resolution requiring states to prevent proliferation of WMDs to non-state actors.
## V-Z
### VX Nerve Agent
An extremely toxic persistent nerve agent, more potent than sarin, that can remain active in the environment for extended periods.
### Vulnerability
A weakness in a system that can be exploited to cause harm or unauthorized access.
### Weaponization
The process of adapting a substance or technology for use as a weapon.
### WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction)
Weapons that can cause large-scale death and destruction, including nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological weapons.
## AI-Specific Terms
### Attention Mechanism
A component in transformer models that determines which parts of the input are most relevant for generating each part of the output.
### Context Window
The amount of text (tokens) an AI model can consider when generating a response, affecting how much conversation history it remembers.
### Fine-tuning
The process of further training a pre-trained model on specific data to adapt it to particular tasks or domains.
### Token
The basic unit of text processed by AI models, which can be a word, part of a word, or punctuation.
### Transformer Architecture
The neural network architecture underlying most modern LLMs, using self-attention mechanisms to process sequences.
## Security and Legal Terms
### Accessory Liability
Legal responsibility for assisting or facilitating a crime committed by another party.
### Civil Liability
Legal responsibility for damages in civil court, typically requiring compensation rather than criminal punishment.
### Criminal Negligence
Failure to exercise reasonable care that results in criminal harm, potentially applicable to deploying unsafe AI systems.
### Duty of Care
Legal obligation to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing harm to others.
### Fiduciary Duty
